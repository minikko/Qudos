We do not tolerate the use of drugs or alcohol by drivers or inappropriate behavior towards passengers and vice versa. If you believe that your driver is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or behaving in an inappropriate and reckless manner that is both illegal and makes you feel uncomfortable, please ask the driver to terminate the trip immediately. If you feel that you are in danger, please contact the police directly. After the ride has ended, please provide feedback using the app to report the issue or email support@drivequdos.com for the matter to be handled accordingly.
